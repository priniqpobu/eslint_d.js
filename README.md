## What's New in QuarkXPress 9.3?
     
QuarkXPress 9.3 introduces several new features and enhancements that make it easier and faster to create high-quality content for print and digital platforms. Some of the highlights are:
     
- **HTML5 Publications:** QuarkXPress 9.3 allows you to create HTML5-based content that can be viewed on any device, such as smartphones, tablets, and desktops. You can use the same layout tools and features that you use for print design, and export your content as HTML5 publications that are responsive, interactive, and engaging. You can also publish your HTML5 publications as native apps for Android devices using the App Studio.
- **Hunspell Spell Checker:** QuarkXPress 9.3 integrates the Hunspell spell checking engine as an additional option alongside the current Dieckmann engine. Hunspell is an open-source spell checker that supports more than 100 languages and dialects, including Arabic, Hebrew, and Urdu. You can also customize your own dictionaries and add new words to the user dictionary.
- **Picture Content Variable:** QuarkXPress 9.3 lets you create a picture content variable that can be used with any picture box across multiple layouts of a project. This means that if you change the picture in one place, it will automatically update everywhere else where the variable is used. This can save you time and ensure consistency in your design.
- **Long Document Support:** QuarkXPress 9.3 increases the maximum number of pages in a document from 4,000 to 10,000. This is useful for creating long documents such as books, magazines, catalogs, and manuals. You can also import IDML and INDD documents of up to 10,000 pages into QuarkXPress.
